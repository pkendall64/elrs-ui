# Build-time feature flags for Vite (copy to .env or .env.local and adjust)
# Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_

# Show the Vite/Lit logos block on the sample component (default disabled)
# Enable by setting to true, or use `npm run build:with-logo` which sets this at build time
VITE_FEATURE_SHOW_LOGOS=false

# Enable the counter button on the sample component
VITE_FEATURE_ENABLE_COUNTER=true

# HTML feature blocks in index.html (and other HTML) can be toggled with env flags.
# Use markers like:
#   <!-- FEATURE:HTML_HEADER --> ... <!-- /FEATURE:HTML_HEADER -->
# To invert the logic for a block, prefix with NOT or !
#   <!-- FEATURE:NOT HTML_HEADER --> ... <!-- /FEATURE:NOT HTML_HEADER -->
#   <!-- FEATURE:!HTML_HEADER --> ... <!-- /FEATURE:!HTML_HEADER -->
# The controlling env var is derived from the NAME (after NOT/!) as:
#   VITE_FEATURE_HTML_<NAME> or fallback to VITE_FEATURE_<NAME>
# Example flags for the HTML_HEADER block:
#   VITE_FEATURE_HTML_HTML_HEADER=true    (HTML-specific)
#   or VITE_FEATURE_HTML_HEADER=true      (generic fallback)
VITE_FEATURE_HTML_HEADER=false
